Cluster-based Alignment-free Novel Domain Iterative Discovery

This is a program undergoing sporadic development. Its intent is to discover novel domains by excluding known domain regions from proteins and subsequently utilising PSI-BLAST to find potential domain regions which are subsequently clustered based on alignment-free distance measures and iteratively used as HMMER queries until convergence is reached.
